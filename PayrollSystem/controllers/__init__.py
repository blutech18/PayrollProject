Controller layer for the PROLY Payroll Management System.

Controllers sit between PyQt6 views and the models:
- Receive signals/events from views (button clicks, form submissions)
- Call into models for database operations and pandas-based processing
- Push data back into the views (populate tables, labels, etc.)
